I am Digital marketer with experience in building and implementing strategies focused on Google and Facebook Ads largely for small to medium-sized businesses. Successfully grew organic revenue and created an interactive web presence across platforms for clients.  I am a deeply inquisitive person and love uncovering patterns and discovering the meaning behind the data. It thrills me to prove out intuition with numbers. Gone are the days of Mad Men when marketers used to throw around ideas and hope something stuck. Today marketing is as much about data as it's about creativity. I hope to bring both these domains together.
